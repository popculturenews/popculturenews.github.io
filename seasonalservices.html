<br>
<p>All of our founders are working hard, and we plan to donate 25% of the money. The other 75% will be invested in future fundraisers in the business.
  Our business has been working hard for roughly 1 year, and we don’t mind doing our work. Many would say that we have fun doing our work, and it is a passion of ours to do it. Please take our services as a “Win Win” situation for all these reasons.</p>
<br>
<p>Sincerely, Rhodes, Hirshbergs, and many more charity lovers.</p>
