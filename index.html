<br>
<br>
<p>All of our founders are working hard, and we plan to donate 25% of the money. The other 75% will be invested in future fundraisers in the business.
Our business has been working hard for roughly 1 year, and it would be an honor for us to get any amount of money from you. Your contribution would mean so much to us, and if you have already contributed. “Thank you.”
</p>
<br>
<p>Sincerely, Rhodes, Hirshbergs, and many more charity lovers.</p>
